Moran I is computed separately for each origin and horizon. A positive value suggests clustering of similarly signed forecast errors under the chosen geographic weights. Summary means are descriptive; they do not have a pooled p-value. Permutation p-values and BH q-values are exploratory, conditional on the fitted model, residual exchangeability, and unvalidated ZIP-ZCTA identifiers. Count residual magnitudes vary by region; this can affect the interpretation. Nonsignificance does not prove spatial adequacy. K4/K12 are sensitivity checks, not selected by results. No model refit.
